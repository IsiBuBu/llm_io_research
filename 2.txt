Of course. Here are the tables for Research Question 2, which detail the **Strategic Capability Profile** of each LLM agent. These tables present the "why" behind the performance outcomes, focusing on the behavioral tendencies measured by your MAgIC metrics.

The structure mirrors that of the RQ1 tables, with one comprehensive table per game. This allows for a clear, side-by-side comparison of how each model's strategic behavior adapts to the different experimental conditions. The data for these tables would be generated by your analysis pipeline from the `magic_behavioral_metrics.csv` file, which aggregates the results from all simulations.

Each cell presents the **mean** of the metric, along with the **95% confidence interval** in the format `Mean [Lower Bound, Upper Bound]`.

How to Generate the Plot Data

The data sources remain consistent: the aggregated magic_behavioral_metrics.csv for summary plots and the raw, round-by-round JSON results for the detailed behavioral plots.

1. High-Level Behavioral Profiles

This section provides the "30,000-foot view" of model behavior.

Plot 1.1: Overall MAgIC Profile by Market Structure

How to Get It: From magic_behavioral_metrics.csv, create an "overall" score for each of the seven MAgIC paper metrics by averaging the scores from the games where they are measured. Do this separately for the 3-player and 5-player conditions.

Axes: Seven axes radiating from a central point: Judgment, Reasoning, Deception, Self-awareness, Cooperation, Coordination, and Rationality.

Look: Two separate radar charts: one titled "Overall MAgIC Profile (3-Player Condition)" and the other "Overall MAgIC Profile (5-Player Condition)".

Data: Each chart will include all challenger models and the Random Player.

2. Game-Specific Behavioral Profiles

This section dives into the unique strategic context of each game.

Plot 2.1: Game-Specific Behavioral Adaptation

How to Get It: From magic_behavioral_metrics.csv, extract the three specific MAgIC metrics relevant to each game.

Axes: Y-axis: Metric Score (0 to 1); X-axis: The three game-specific MAgIC metrics.

Look: A grouped bar chart. For each metric on the x-axis, there will be a cluster of bars, with each bar representing a challenger model. Each bar will be split or paired to show the 3-Player result vs. the 5-Player result.

Data: Create one chart for each of the four games, including all challenger models and the Random Player.

3. Dynamic Games: Per-Round Behavioral Analysis

These plots provide the deepest level of insight into moment-to-moment strategic decisions.

Plot 3.1: Collusion Stability "Survival Curve" (Green & Porter)

How to Get It: From the raw JSONs, calculate the proportion of simulations still in the "Collusive" state at the start of each round.

Axes: Y-axis: "Proportion of Games in Collusion"; X-axis: "Game Round".

Look: A line plot.

Data: Include all challenger models.

Structural Variations: Use a single overlay plot to compare the 3-Player (solid lines) and 5-Player (dashed lines) conditions.

Plot 3.2: "Pressure on Collusion" Analysis (Green & Porter)

How to Get It: From the raw JSONs, calculate the "Price Cushion" (market_price - trigger_price) for every collusive period.

Axes: Y-axis: "Price Cushion ($)"; X-axis: "Challenger Model".

Look: A split violin plot or a grouped box plot, with a horizontal line at y=0 marking the trigger point.

Data: Include all challenger models and the Random Player.

Structural Variations: The plot should directly compare the 3-player vs. 5-player conditions for each model.

Plot 3.3: Nuanced Reporting Strategy Over Time (Athey & Bagwell)

How to Get It: From the raw JSONs, calculate the per-round rates of both truthful signaling (reporting "low" when true cost was "low") and deception (reporting "low" when true cost was "high").

Axes: Y-axis: "Proportion of 'Low' Reports"; X-axis: "Game Round".

Look: A line plot, with two lines (truthful signaling and deception) per model.

Data: Include all challenger models.

Structural Variations: Use a single overlay plot to compare the 3-Player (solid lines) and 5-Player (dashed lines) conditions.

Plot 3.4: Reporting Strategy Matrix (Athey & Bagwell)

How to Get It: From the raw JSONs, aggregate the data for each challenger model across all rounds and simulations to count the frequency of each (True Cost, Reported Cost) pair.

Axes: Y-axis: True Cost ("High", "Low"); X-axis: Reported Cost ("High", "Low").

Look: A heatmap. The four cells will show the probability of each action pair, with the value annotated in each cell.

Data: This plot provides a "fingerprint" of each model's overall reporting strategy.

Structural Variations: You will create two separate heatmaps for each challenger model: one for its aggregate strategy in the 3-Player condition and another for the 5-Player condition. This provides a clear, side-by-side comparison of how their overall strategy of honesty vs. deception adapts to increased social complexity.
