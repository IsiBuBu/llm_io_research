1. Salop (1979): Spatial Competition Game
Context: You are Firm  in a circular market with {number_of_players} competing firms. Customers are distributed evenly around the circle and will buy from the firm offering the lowest total cost (price + transportation cost). The total market size is {market_size} customers.
Economic Information:
•	Your marginal cost: ${marginal_cost} per unit.
•	Your fixed cost: ${fixed_cost}.
•	Customer transportation cost: ${transport_cost} per unit of distance.
•	Consumer reservation price (max value): ${v}.
•	Your profit is calculated as: (Your Price - ${marginal_cost}) × Quantity Sold - ${fixed_cost}.
Your Task: Choose your optimal price for this period to maximize your profit. Your competitors are simultaneously making their own pricing decisions.
Output Format: {"price": <number>}
 
3. Spulber (1995): Bertrand Competition with Incomplete Information
Context: You are bidding in a winner-take-all price auction against {number_of_competitors} rival firms. The firm with the lowest price wins the entire market. All losing firms earn zero profit.
Information Structure: You know your own marginal cost, but your competitors' costs are unknown. They are independently drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of ${rival_cost_mean} and a standard deviation of ${rival_cost_std}.
Economic Information:
•	Your marginal cost: ${your_cost} per unit.
•	Market demand at a given price p is D(p) = {demand_intercept} - p.
•	Your profit if you win is: (Your Price - ${your_cost}) × ({demand_intercept} - Your Price).
•	Your profit if you lose is: $0.
Your Task: Choose your price to maximize your expected profit, considering the uncertainty about your rivals' costs.
Output Format: {"price": <number>}
 
Green & Porter (1984): Dynamic Oligopoly with Demand Uncertainty
Context: You are Firm {player_id} in a {number_of_players}-firm oligopoly producing a homogeneous product over many periods. The market price is affected by random demand shocks, making it difficult to know if a low price is due to low demand or a competitor cheating.
Rules of Engagement: The market operates in one of two states: Collusive or Price War.
•	In a Collusive state, the agreed-upon action is to produce the collusive_quantity of {collusive_quantity} units.
•	If the market price in a collusive period drops below the trigger_price of ${trigger_price}, the market will enter a Price War state for the next {punishment_duration} periods.
•	In a Price War state, all firms revert to noncooperative behavior.
Market Dynamics:
•	Market Price = {base_demand} - (Total Industry Quantity) + Demand Shock.
•	The Demand Shock is random each period (Normal with mean 0, std {demand_shock_std}).
Economic Information:
•	Your marginal cost: ${marginal_cost} per unit.
•	Your total payoff is the Net Present Value (NPV) of profits across all periods, calculated with a discount factor of ${discount_factor} per period.
Current Market Information:
•	Period: {current_round}
•	Current Market State: {current_market_state}
•	Previous market prices: {price_history}
Your Task: Choose your quantity for this period to maximize your total long-term profit, balancing the immediate gains from producing more against the risk of triggering a future price war.

Athey & Bagwell (2008): Collusive Information Management
Context: You are Firm {player_id} in a {number_of_players}-firm cartel operating over many periods. The cartel coordinates market shares to maximize joint profits, but each firm has private information about its costs.
Information & Market Share Rules:
•	Each period, your marginal cost is either "high" (costhigh)or"low"({cost_low}).
•	Cost types are persistent ({persistence_probability * 100}% probability your cost stays the same next period).
•	Other firms only see your public cost reports.
•	Market shares are allocated based on reports as follows:
o	If one firm reports "low" and all others report "high," the "low" firm gets 100% of the market.
o	If multiple firms report "low," they split the market evenly.
o	If all firms report "high," they split the market evenly.
Economic Information:
•	Market price: Fixed at ${market_price} per unit.
•	Your profit is: (${market_price} - Your True Cost) × Your Allocated Market Share.
•	Your total payoff is the Net Present Value (NPV) of profits across all periods, calculated with a discount factor of ${discount_factor} per period.
Current Game State:
•	Period: {current_round}
•	Your true cost this period: {current_cost_type}
•	History of all firms' past reports: {all_reports_history_detailed}
Your Task: Decide whether to report your cost as "high" or "low" for this period to maximize your total long-term profit.
Output Format: {"report": "<high or low>"}

Of course. Here is a detailed, implementable guide for testing the correlation hypotheses for each game. This includes the rationale, the specific metrics and their formulas, the data collection algorithm, the statistical test to use, and an interpretation of the potential results.
Overall Methodology
For each correlation, you will generate a dataset of paired observations. Each observation will represent a single agent's performance over a batch of simulations.
1.	Run Experiments: For each LLM agent you are testing, run a batch of N full game simulations (e.g., N=50).
2.	Calculate Aggregate Scores: For each agent, calculate its average score for the relevant MAgIC metric and the relevant performance metric over the entire batch of N simulations.
3.	Create Paired Data: This will give you a set of paired data points, where each point is (Agent_X_MAgIC_Score, Agent_X_Performance_Score).
4.	Calculate Correlation: Use the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) to measure the linear relationship between the two sets of scores.
Pearson Correlation Formula:
r=∑(xi−xˉ)2∑(yi−yˉ)2∑(xi−xˉ)(yi−yˉ)
Where x is the MAgIC metric score and y is the performance metric score for each agent.
 
1. Salop (1979): Monopolistic Competition
Hypothesis 1: Judgment vs. Win Rate
•	Rationale: Tests if an agent's ability to make high-quality, profitable pricing decisions directly leads to winning more often.
•	Metrics Involved:
o	Judgment (Profitable Win Rate): Score=Total Games PlayedNumber of Games Won with Profit>0
o	Win Rate: Score=Total Games PlayedNumber of Games with Highest Profit
•	Interpretation: A strong positive correlation (r→1) would confirm that superior judgment is a primary driver of competitive success.
Hypothesis 2: Self-Awareness vs. Market Share Captured
•	Rationale: Checks if an agent's awareness of its viable market position allows it to control a larger segment.
•	Metrics Involved:
o	Self-Awareness (Market Viability Rate):Score=Total Games PlayedNumber of Games where Quantity Sold>0
o	Market Share Captured: Market Share=N1∑i=1Nmarket_sizeQuantity Soldi
•	Interpretation: A positive correlation would suggest that agents that consistently price themselves to be viable in the market also tend to command a larger share on average.
Hypothesis 3: Rationality vs. Average Profit
•	Rationale: Tests if the foundational rational behavior of avoiding unprofitable prices is correlated with achieving higher overall profits.
•	Metrics Involved:
o	Rationality (Profitability Rate): Score=Total Games PlayedNumber of Games with Profit≥0
o	Average Profit: Profit=N1∑i=1NProfiti
•	Interpretation: A strong positive correlation would indicate that disciplined, loss-avoiding strategies are the most profitable.
Hypothesis 4: Judgment vs. Profit Volatility
•	Rationale: Explores if superior judgment leads to more stable and predictable profits.
•	Metrics Involved:
o	Judgment (Profitable Win Rate): Score=Total Games PlayedNumber of Games Won with Profit>0
o	Profit Volatility: Volatility=N−11∑i=1N(Profiti−Profit)2 
•	Interpretation: A negative correlation would suggest that agents with better judgment employ more stable, less risky strategies. A zero or positive correlation might imply that high judgment involves taking calculated risks that lead to more variable outcomes.
 
2. Green & Porter (1984): Dynamic Oligopoly
Hypothesis 1: Rationality vs. Win Rate
•	Rationale: Tests if the agent who best demonstrates long-term rationality (by cooperating) ultimately wins the game (achieves the highest NPV).
•	Metrics Involved:
o	Rationality (Long-Term Rationality Rate):Score=Total PeriodsNumber of Periods the Firm Cooperated
o	Win Rate: Score=Total SimulationsNumber of Simulations with Highest NPV
•	Interpretation: A strong positive correlation would prove that patient, cooperative strategies are the winning approach in this game.
Hypothesis 2: Cooperation vs. Reversion Frequency
•	Rationale: A validation test to check if a higher rate of successful cartel cooperation directly leads to fewer punishment phases.
•	Metrics Involved:
o	Cooperation (Collusion Success Rate): Score=Total PeriodsNumber of Periods in Collusive State
o	Reversion Frequency: Score=Total PeriodsNumber of Times a Price War is Triggered
•	Interpretation: A strong negative correlation (r→−1) is expected. If this is not observed, it could indicate a flaw in the simulation logic or the metrics' implementation.
Hypothesis 3: Coordination vs. Total Industry Profit
•	Rationale: Measures if an individual agent's adherence to the rules contributes to a larger profit "pie" for the entire market.
•	Metrics Involved:
o	Coordination (Constructive Action Rate):Score=Number of Periods in Collusive StateNumber of times Cooperated in Collusive State
o	Total Industry Profit: TIP=∑j=1MNPVj (where M is the number of firms)
•	Interpretation: A positive correlation would show that disciplined individual behavior (Coordination) is key to maximizing collective success.
Hypothesis 4: Cooperation vs. Average Profit
•	Rationale: Tests if a stable, cooperative market environment benefits the individual agent's bottom line.

### **General Pre-Simulation Step: Generating Randomness**
For reproducibility, you should generate and save all random elements before the experiments begin.

* **Algorithm: Pre-generating Random Lists**
    1.  **For Green & Porter:** For each of the $N$ simulations, generate a list of $T$ random numbers drawn from the Normal distribution $N(0, \text{demand\_shock\_std}^2)$. Save this list of lists. During simulation $i$, the engine will use the $i^{th}$ list of demand shocks.
    2.  **For Athey & Bagwell:** For each of the $N$ simulations and for each player, generate a list of $T$ cost types.
        * Draw the first cost (`cost_1`) from the stationary distribution (50/50 chance of "high" or "low").
        * For $t=2$ to $T$, determine `cost_t`. With `persistence_probability`, `cost_t` = `cost_{t-1}`. Otherwise, it flips.
        * Save these lists of cost types. During simulation $i$, player $j$ will receive the corresponding pre-generated list of true costs.

for green porter if I do 50 games per challenger, can I do 50 different demand shock lists, that are the same for all challenger setups?
Yes, you absolutely should do that. Using the same 50 demand shock lists for all challenger setups is the correct and standard scientific practice for this type of experiment.

Why This is the Correct Approach

It Ensures a Fair Comparison: To accurately compare the strategic skill of different LLMs, you must ensure they face the exact same environmental conditions. The sequence of random demand shocks is a major part of the game's environment. Using the same lists guarantees that one LLM doesn't perform better or worse than another simply due to the "luck of the draw" with the shocks.

It Isolates the Variable Being Tested: This method allows you to control the experiment. The only significant variable changing between a simulation with Challenger A and the same simulation with Challenger B is the agent itself. Any difference in performance can then be more confidently attributed to the difference in the LLMs' strategies.

It Makes Your Results Robust: This approach is a form of variance reduction. By removing randomness as a source of difference between your experimental runs, you increase the statistical power of your results and can be more certain of your conclusions.

Think of it like testing two race car drivers. To find out who is more skillful, you have them drive on the same track under the same weather conditions. Your 50 pre-generated demand shock lists are the "tracks" for your experiment.

the same for athey with cost types? so the challenger llms get same different cost types per game, should the defender llms themselves get the same different cost type list or should we have all them a different list each game?
Yes, the exact same principle applies to the Athey & Bagwell game, but with an important distinction for the defenders' cost lists.

1. The Challenger's Cost Lists

You are correct. To ensure a fair and controlled experiment, every challenger LLM you test must face the exact same sequence of 50 pre-generated true_cost lists.

If Challenger A plays simulation #23, it must be assigned the same pre-generated list of high/low costs that Challenger B is assigned when it plays simulation #23.

2. The Defenders' Cost Lists

For each simulation, each defender LLM should also have its own unique, pre-generated list of cost types. You should not give all defenders the same list as the challenger, nor should you generate new random lists for them each time.

This is for two critical reasons:

Fidelity to the Economic Model: The Athey & Bagwell paper is built on the core assumption that cost shocks are independent across firms. Giving every player the same list of costs would make their costs perfectly correlated, which violates the paper's model and would test a much simpler strategic problem.


Scientific Control: To fairly compare Challenger A and Challenger B, they must face the exact same competitive environment. This environment includes the specific cost sequences of their opponents.

Correct Implementation Example for a 3-Player Simulation (#23):

Pre-Generation Step (Done once before any experiments):

You generate and save three separate, independently created cost lists for simulation #23:

challenger_costs_23.csv -> [low, high, high, low, ...]

defender1_costs_23.csv -> [high, high, low, high, ...]

defender2_costs_23.csv -> [low, low, high, low, ...]

Experiment Step (Repeated for each challenger):

When you test Challenger A in simulation #23, you will use these three specific lists.

When you test Challenger B in simulation #23, you will use the exact same three lists again.

This method ensures your experiment is both fair (all challengers face the same conditions) and true to the economic theory you are testing (costs are independent across firms).

Number of Games and Rounds
Main Experiments: For each experimental condition (e.g., "Salop with 3 players"), you should run at least 30-50 full game simulations to ensure statistically significant and robust results.
Ablation Study: For each ablation condition (e.g., "Salop with high transport cost"), you can run a smaller set of 15-20 simulations, as the goal is to observe the direction of the effect rather than a full performance benchmark.

Main Experiments: Structural Variations
1. Static Games (Salop & Spulber)
Variable to Test: Number of Players. This tests how LLM strategy adapts to changes in market concentration and social complexity.
Modes:
3-Player Games (1 challenger vs. 2 defenders).
5-Player Games (1 challenger vs. 4 defenders).
2. Dynamic Games (Green & Porter & Athey & Bagwell)
Variable to Test: Time Horizon. This tests an LLM's strategic patience and its ability to reason about intertemporal trade-offs.
Modes:
Short-Horizon (15 rounds).
Long-Horizon (50 rounds).

are you fine with this ?
Yes, this is an excellent and methodologically sound plan. The number of simulations and the choice of structural variables are both well-justified and will allow you to draw clear, robust conclusions.

Number of Games and Rounds

Your proposed numbers are ideal.

Main Experiments (30-50 simulations): This is a strong sample size. It's large enough to ensure that your results are not due to random chance and will allow you to perform meaningful statistical tests to compare the performance of different LLMs.

Ablation Study (15-20 simulations): This is a smart and practical choice. You correctly identify that the goal here is to observe the direction of a strategic change, not to perform a full-power comparison. This approach will efficiently show how sensitive the LLMs are to key parameters while conserving computational resources.

Main Experiments: Structural Variations

Your choice of variables to test is perfect, as each one targets the central strategic tension of its respective game type.

Static Games (Number of Players): Varying the number of players is the most direct way to alter the intensity of competition. This will effectively test how LLM pricing and bidding strategies adapt as a market moves from a tight oligopoly (3 players) to a more competitive environment (5 players).

Dynamic Games (Time Horizon): Varying the time horizon is a classic method for testing strategic patience. A shorter horizon (15 rounds) introduces significant "end-game effects," which might tempt an LLM to defect or lie near the end. A longer horizon (50 rounds) makes the long-term benefits of cooperation much more valuable, creating a stronger incentive for patient, forward-looking behavior.

Of course. Here is a detailed guide on how to implement the **Random Player** and the **Q-Learning Player** as challengers in your experiments. This provides the necessary algorithms and workflows to create these non-LLM baselines.

---
## **1. Implementing the Random Player (All Games)**
The Random Player serves as a simple, non-strategic baseline. Its purpose is to choose a valid action uniformly at random from a pre-defined, reasonable action space. It does not learn or react to the game's history.

### **Game 1: Salop (1979) - Random Price Player**
* **Action Space:** A continuous range of prices between the firm's `marginal_cost` (the lowest rational price) and the consumer's `v` (the highest possible price that could result in a sale).
* **Algorithm:**
    1.  When it is the Random Player's turn to act, the simulation engine provides its `marginal_cost`.
    2.  The player selects a floating-point number uniformly at random from the interval [`marginal_cost`, `v`].
    3.  Return `{"price": <randomly_chosen_price>}`.

### **Game 2: Spulber (1995) - Random Bidder**
* **Action Space:** A continuous range of prices between the firm's private `your_cost` and the `demand_intercept`.
* **Algorithm:**
    1.  The engine provides the player's private `your_cost`.
    2.  The player selects a floating-point number uniformly at random from the interval [`your_cost`, `demand_intercept`].
    3.  Return `{"price": <randomly_chosen_bid>}`.

### **Game 3: Green & Porter (1984) - Random Quantity Player**
* **Action Space:** A discrete set containing the two most strategically relevant quantities.
* **Algorithm:**
    1.  The engine prompts the player for its quantity.
    2.  The player chooses with 50% probability from the set {`collusive_quantity`, `cournot_quantity`}.
    3.  Return `{"quantity": <randomly_chosen_quantity>}`.

### **Game 4: Athey & Bagwell (2008) - Random Reporter**
* **Action Space:** A discrete set of the two valid reports.
* **Algorithm:**
    1.  The engine prompts the player for its report.
    2.  The player chooses with 50% probability from the set {"high", "low"}.
    3.  Return `{"report": <randomly_chosen_report>}`.

---
## **2. Implementing the Q-Learning Player (Dynamic Games)**
The Q-Learning Player is a sophisticated, learning-based baseline. It learns a good strategy by playing the game many times and updating its estimate of the value of actions in different states. The implementation follows a two-phase process: **Training** and **Evaluation**. The logic is adapted from the Q-learning agent described in Keppo et al. (2025) [cite_start][cite: 2533-2534].

### **Phase 1: Training Workflow (Done once before experiments)**
1.  **Initialize Q-Table:** Create a data structure (e.g., a dictionary or table) to store Q-values for every state-action pair, initialized to zero.
2.  **Self-Play Simulation:** Run the Q-learning agent against copies of itself for a very large number of simulations (e.g., 10,000+).
3.  **Learn and Explore:** In each period of each training simulation, the agent:
    a.  Observes the current state `s`.
    b.  Selects an action `a` using an **ε-greedy policy** (see below).
    c.  Receives a profit (reward) $\pi_t$ and observes the next state `s'`.
    d.  Updates its Q-table using the **Q-update rule**.
4.  **Save Q-Table:** After training is complete, save the final, learned Q-table.

### **Phase 2: Evaluation Workflow (The Main Experiment)**
1.  **Load Q-Table:** Initialize the Q-learning challenger with its pre-trained Q-table.
2.  **Set to Exploit:** Set the exploration rate, $\epsilon$, to 0. The agent will now always choose the action with the highest Q-value for its current state.
3.  **Run Experiment:** The Q-learning agent now plays against the defender LLMs for the $N$ main experiment simulations. Its actions are determined by its learned Q-table, not by random choice or an LLM prompt.

### **Implementation for Green & Porter (1984)**
* **State Space ($S$):** The state must be something the agent can observe. A tractable state representation is a tuple of (`current_market_state`, `punishment_timer_value`).
    * Example states: `("Collusive", 0)`, `("Reversionary", 3)`, `("Reversionary", 2)`, etc.
* **Action Space ($A$):** A discrete set of quantities: {`collusive_quantity`, `cournot_quantity`}.
* **Q-Update Rule:** At the end of period $t$, after observing the reward $\pi_t$ and next state $s'$, the Q-value is updated using the Bellman equation:
    $Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow (1-\alpha) \cdot Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \cdot (\pi_t + \delta \cdot \max_{a'} Q(s', a'))$
    * $\alpha$: The learning rate (e.g., `0.15`). A hyperparameter that controls how much new information overrides old information.
    * $\delta$: The `discount_factor` from your game constants (e.g., `0.95`).
* **ε-Greedy Policy:** The rule for choosing an action during training.
    * With probability $1-\epsilon$, choose the action $a$ that maximizes $Q(s, a)$ (exploit).
    * With probability $\epsilon$, choose a random action from the action space (explore).
    * $\epsilon$ decays over time to shift from exploration to exploitation: $\epsilon = e^{-(\text{training\_episode} \times \beta)}$, where $\beta$ is a decay rate (e.g., `0.004`).

### **Implementation for Athey & Bagwell (2008)**
* **State Space ($S$):** The full history is too large for a Q-table. A tractable, memory-1 state space is necessary. The state can be a tuple of the public reports from the previous period: `(player1_report_{t-1}, player2_report_{t-1}, ...)` combined with the agent's own private `true_cost_t`.
    * Example state for a 3-player game: `("high", "low", "high", "low")`, where the first three are public reports and the last is the agent's private information.
* **Action Space ($A$):** A discrete set of reports: {"high", "low"}.
* **Q-Update Rule & ε-Greedy Policy:** The formulas are identical to those used in the Green & Porter implementation, just applied to the new state and action spaces.
