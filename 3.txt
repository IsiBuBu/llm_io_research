Of course. Here is the complete and updated guide for the tables and plots for **Research Question 3**, which focuses on the relationship between strategic capabilities and economic performance.

This plan incorporates your refined, two-part structure: a foundational correlation analysis that is presented selectively, and an advanced predictive "deep dive."

### How to Generate the Data

The analysis for RQ3 is driven by your `analysis/analyze_correlations.py` script. The standard workflow is:
1.  Run `run_experiments.py` to get the raw results.
2.  Run `run_analysis.py` to generate the `performance_metrics.csv` and `magic_behavioral_metrics.csv` files.
3.  Modify `analysis/analyze_correlations.py` to test **every game-specific MAgIC metric against both `Win Rate` and `Average Profit`/`NPV`**.
4.  The script will output a comprehensive `correlations_analysis.csv` file, which will be the source for the following tables and plots.

### Part 1: Foundational Correlation Analysis (Tables & Plots)

This part establishes the direct, observable relationships between strategic behaviors and economic outcomes.

#### **Table 3.1: Summary of Key Correlations (For Main Thesis Body)**

This table is your primary narrative tool, presenting only the most important and statistically significant findings.

* **Structure**: A single, concise table, segmented by game.
* **Content**: This table will only include correlations from your full analysis that are **statistically significant (p < 0.05)**. You can also include a theoretically important non-significant finding if the *absence* of a correlation is a key discovery. All columns from the master table should be present.

| Game | MAgIC Metric | Performance Metric | r-value | p-value | n |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Salop** | Judgment | Win Rate | 0.82 | 0.002* | 12 |
| | Judgment | Average Profit | 0.75 | 0.005* | 12 |
| **Athey & Bagwell** | Deception | Win Rate | 0.15 | 0.641 | 12 |

*(Note: The Athey & Bagwell result is included as an example of a theoretically interesting but non-significant finding.)*

#### **Appendix Table A.1: Master Correlation Table (For Appendix)**

This table demonstrates scientific rigor and transparency by providing the complete, unfiltered results of your analysis.

* **Structure**: A comprehensive table showing the results for **every combination** of a game's specific MAgIC metrics tested against both `Win Rate` and `Average Profit`/`NPV`.
* **Content**: This table will have the same columns as Table 3.1 but will include all results, regardless of their p-value. For each game, there will be six rows (3 MAgIC metrics x 2 Performance metrics).

#### **Plot 3.1: Correlation Heatmaps**

* **How to Get It**: From your `correlations_analysis.csv`, create a pivot table for each game where MAgIC metrics are rows, performance metrics are columns, and cell values are the Pearson correlation coefficients.
* **Axes**: Y-axis: MAgIC Behavioral Metrics; X-axis: Performance Metrics (`Win Rate`, `Average Profit`/`NPV`).
* **Look**: A **heatmap**. Cells are colored by correlation strength and annotated with the r-value.
* **Data**: Create **one separate heatmap for each of the four games**.

#### **Plot 3.2: Scatter Plots for Significant Correlations**

* **How to Get It**: For each significant relationship identified in Table 3.1, create a scatter plot using the data from the `...metrics.csv` files.
* **Axes**: Y-axis: Performance Metric Score; X-axis: MAgIC Metric Score.
* **Look**: A **scatter plot**. Each point represents a model's performance in a specific condition.
* **Data**: Include all challenger models and the Random Player.
* **Structural Variations**: Use different colors or shapes for the **3-player vs. 5-player conditions**. Add a regression line to visualize the trend.

### Part 2: Advanced Predictive Modeling (The "Deep Dive")

This part moves beyond simple correlation to determine which behaviors are the most important *drivers* of success.

#### **Plot 3.3: SHAP Summary Plot for Predicting Performance**

* **How to Get It**: This requires an advanced analysis step. You will train a predictive model (e.g., logistic regression for `Win Rate` or a gradient boosting model for `Average Profit`) using the seven overall MAgIC metrics as input features. You will then use a library like SHAP to analyze the trained model.
* **Axes**: Y-axis: MAgIC Metrics (features), ranked by importance; X-axis: SHAP Value (Impact on model output).
* **Look**: A **SHAP summary plot**. This plot shows which behaviors were most predictive of success and the direction of their effect.
* **Data**: You will create **two main SHAP plots**: one for the model predicting `Win Rate` and another for the model predicting `Average Profit`, using data aggregated across all games and conditions to build a general model of strategic success.
