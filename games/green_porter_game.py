Market conditions are uncertain - demand shocks affect the market price in ways that make it difficult to distinguish between low demand and competitor cheating.

**Market Dynamics:** 
- Market price = ${constants.GP_DEMAND_INTERCEPT} - (Total Industry Quantity) + Demand Shock
- Demand shock is random each period: Normal(0, ${constants.GP_DEMAND_SHOCK_STD})
- Your quantity decision affects both current profit and future market conditions
- Other firms observe market prices but not individual quantities or demand shocks

**Economic Information:**
- Your marginal cost: ${constants.GP_MARGINAL_COST} per unit
- Discount factor: {config.discount_factor} (future profits are worth {int(config.discount_factor*100)}% of current profits)
- Current period profit: (Market Price - ${constants.GP_MARGINAL_COST}) Ã— Your Quantity
- Total payoff: Sum of discounted profits across all periods

**Strategic Environment:** This market presents a complex intertemporal trade-off. Higher production increases current profits but may signal aggressive competition to rivals, potentially triggering competitive responses. The presence of demand uncertainty means that low prices could result from either competitor aggression or poor market conditions.

**Historical Context:** Industry participants have learned that sustainable profits require some degree of market discipline. However, each firm faces ongoing temptation to expand production for short-term gains.

**Current Market Information:**
- Period: {current_round} of {config.number_of_rounds}
- Previous market prices: {history[-3:] if len(history) >= 3 else history}
- Your previous quantities: {player_history.get('quantities', [])[-3:]}
- Your previous period profits: {[round(p, 2) for p in player_history.get('profits', [])[-3:]]}

**Strategic Decision:** Choose your quantity for this period, balancing current profit maximization against the long-term health of the market and your relationships with competitors.

**Output Format:** {{"quantity": <number>, "reasoning": "<brief explanation of your strategic thinking>"}}"""
