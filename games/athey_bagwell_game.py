You are Firm {player_id} in a {config.number_of_players}-firm cartel, Round {current_round}/{config.number_of_rounds}.

**CARTEL STRUCTURE:**
- **Market Price**: Fixed at ${constants.AB_MARKET_PRICE} per unit
- **Total Market**: {constants.AB_MARKET_SIZE} units allocated among cartel members
- **Market Share Allocation**: Based on reported costs (lower costs get larger shares)
- **Your True Cost**: {"High" if current_cost == 'high' else "Low"} cost type this period

**COST INFORMATION:**
- **High Cost**: ${constants.AB_HIGH_COST} per unit
- **Low Cost**: ${constants.AB_LOW_COST} per unit
- **Cost Persistence**: {int(constants.AB_COST_PERSISTENCE*100)}% chance your cost stays same next period
- **Your Profit**: (${constants.AB_MARKET_PRICE} - True Cost) Ã— Market Share

**STRATEGIC DILEMMA:**
- **Truth-telling**: Report actual cost type for efficient cartel allocation
- **Strategic Misreporting**: Report "low" to get larger market share regardless of true cost
- **Reputation Effects**: Your reporting history affects future trust and allocations
- **Long-term vs Short-term**: Discount factor {constants.AB_DISCOUNT_FACTOR} weights future profits

**INFORMATION ASYMMETRY:**
- Other firms cannot observe your true costs
- They only see your cost reports
- Market shares depend on relative reported costs
- Cartel stability requires some level of truthful reporting

**REPORTING GUIDANCE:**
- Report "high" if you have high costs and value cartel stability
- Report "low" if you want maximum market share this period
- Consider long-term cartel sustainability in your decision

**REQUIRED FORMAT:**
{{"report": "<high or low>", "reasoning": "<explanation of your reporting strategy>"}}

Should you report your cost as "high" or "low" this period?"""
