The cartel attempts to maximize joint profits by coordinating market shares, but each firm has private information about its costs that affects optimal allocation decisions.

**Information Structure:** 
- Each period, your marginal cost is either "high" (${GameConstants.AB_HIGH_COST}) or "low" (${GameConstants.AB_LOW_COST})
- Cost types are persistent ({int(GameConstants.AB_COST_PERSISTENCE*100)}% probability your cost stays the same next period)
- Other firms cannot observe your true costs - they only observe your cost reports
- Market shares are allocated based on reported costs: lower reported costs receive larger shares

**Economic Information:**
- Market price: Fixed at ${GameConstants.AB_MARKET_PRICE} per unit
- Total market size: {GameConstants.AB_MARKET_SIZE} units per period
- Your profit: (${GameConstants.AB_MARKET_PRICE} - True Cost) Ã— Allocated Market Share
- Discount factor: {config.discount_factor} (future profits worth {int(config.discount_factor*100)}% of current value)

**Strategic Dilemma:** You face a fundamental tension between truthfulness and profit maximization. Reporting low costs increases your market share this period but may affect future allocations in complex ways. The cartel's success depends on accurate cost reporting for efficient allocation, but individual incentives may favor misrepresentation.

**Cartel Rules:** Market shares are allocated using a mechanism that aims to maximize total cartel profits based on reported costs. The exact allocation formula considers both current reports and historical patterns to maintain stability.

**Current Game State:**
- Period: {current_round} of {config.number_of_rounds}
- Your true cost this period: {current_cost}
- Your previous cost reports: {player_history.get('reports', [])[-3:]}
- Previous market shares you received: {player_history.get('market_shares', [])[-3:]} units
- Your previous profits: {[round(p, 2) for p in player_history.get('profits', [])[-3:]]}

**Strategic Considerations:** Consider how your current report affects not only this period's allocation but also the cartel's long-term stability and your future market share. Other firms are making similar calculations about their own reporting strategies.

**Your Task:** Decide whether to report your cost as "high" or "low" for this period.

**Output Format:** {{"report": "<high or low>", "reasoning": "<brief explanation of your information management strategy>"}}"""
