    Factory function to create an appropriate agent based on the model name and mode.

    This function acts as a single point of entry for creating any agent,
    whether it's a real LLM agent, a mock agent for testing, or a simple
    baseline like the RandomAgent.

    Args:
        model_name: The name of the model or agent type to create.
        player_id: The unique identifier for this agent in a game.
        mock_mode: If True, returns a mock agent for fast, offline testing.
        **kwargs: Additional arguments to be passed to the agent's constructor.

    Returns:
        An instance of a class that inherits from BaseLLMAgent.
