rq3:

Of course. You are correct that scatter plots are best created after you've run the numbers and know which relationships are most interesting to visualize.

Given your focus on presenting the comprehensive data first, here is a detailed description of the tables and the summary heatmaps you will create for Research Question 3.

## Foundational Analysis: The Tables

The tables are the core of your RQ3 analysis. They provide the complete, precise, and verifiable evidence for your findings. You will create three main sets of tables.

Table 3.1: Master Correlation Table - MAgIC vs. Performance

This will be the central table for this research question, presenting the results for all your pre-defined hypotheses.

Structure: This should be one large table, clearly segmented by game (e.g., using subheadings for Salop, Green & Porter, etc.).

Content:

Hypothesis: A clear, descriptive name for the relationship being tested (e.g., "Judgment vs. Win Rate").

MAgIC Metric: The specific behavioral metric used (e.g., judgment).

Performance Metric: The specific performance metric used (e.g., win_rate).

Pearson Correlation (r): The precise correlation coefficient, a value between -1 and 1, indicating the strength and direction of the linear relationship.

P-value: The value indicating the statistical significance of the result. You should clearly mark results where p < 0.05 with an asterisk (*) to denote significance.

Sample Size (n): The number of data points (i.e., the total number of model-condition pairs) used in the calculation.

Purpose: This table serves as the definitive, comprehensive record of your core validation analysis. It quantitatively demonstrates the link between the strategic behaviors you measured in RQ2 and the economic outcomes you measured in RQ1.

Example Snippet for Table 3.1:
| Game | Hypothesis | MAgIC Metric | Performance Metric | r-value | p-value | n |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Salop | Judgment vs. Win Rate | judgment | win_rate | 0.82 | 0.002* | 12 |
| Athey & Bagwell | Deception vs. Avg. Profit | deception | average_profit | 0.45 | 0.150 | 12 |

Table 3.2: Performance Metric Inter-Correlations (Strategic Trade-offs)

This table reveals the inherent trade-offs in performance outcomes, helping to define different strategic styles.

Structure: You will create a separate, smaller correlation matrix for each of the four games.

Content:

The rows and columns will both be the key performance metrics relevant to that game (e.g., Win Rate, Average Profit, Profit Volatility, Market Share).

The cells of the matrix will contain the Pearson correlation coefficient (r-value) between the corresponding row and column metric.

Purpose: This table allows you to quantitatively answer questions about strategic style. For example, it will show the precise numerical trade-off between maximizing Average Profit and enduring high Profit Volatility (risk vs. reward). It can also reveal if models that successfully capture a large Market Share do so at the expense of their Average Profit.

Table 3.3: MAgIC Metric Inter-Correlations (Behavioral Syndromes)

This table explores the relationships between different strategic capabilities, looking for "behavioral syndromes."

Structure: A separate, smaller correlation matrix for each of the four games.

Content:

The rows and columns will both be the MAgIC metrics relevant to that game (e.g., Rationality, Judgment, Deception).

The cells of the matrix will contain the Pearson correlation coefficient (r-value).

Purpose: This table is for identifying linked behaviors. It will show, for example, if high Rationality is a necessary prerequisite for high Judgment (a strong positive correlation) or if there is an inherent trade-off between Cooperation and Deception in the Athey & Bagwell game (a strong negative correlation).

## High-Impact Visualizations (Used Sparingly)

You will use one type of plotâ€”the heatmapâ€”to provide a high-level visual summary of your most important correlation table.

Correlation Heatmaps (The "Big Picture" Overview)

How Many: You will create one heatmap for each of the four games, and these heatmaps will visualize the results from your Master Correlation Table (3.1) only.

Purpose: The heatmap's job is to provide an intuitive, visual summary of your most important findings. While the table provides the precise numbers, the heatmap allows a reader to immediately see the overall patterns of strategic relationships in a game. It's a powerful tool for quickly identifying which behaviors are most strongly linked to success.

Visualization:

The rows will be the MAgIC metrics.

The columns will be the performance metrics.

Each cell will be colored based on the strength and direction of the correlation coefficient (e.g., using a divergent colormap like red-white-blue, where deep red is a strong positive correlation, deep blue is a strong negative correlation, and white is no correlation).

Each cell should also be annotated with the precise r-value from your table.








 Of course. This is an excellent refinement. The goal is to create a focused and powerful visual narrative that complements your comprehensive tables without being redundant. By adding theoretical benchmarks and more direct visualizations of the LLMs' actions, your analysis will gain significant depth.
Here is the revised, extensive list of high-impact plots for Research Questions 1 and 2, incorporating your new ideas and focusing only on what is most important to show.
## Research Question 1: Economic and Game-Theoretic Performance (The "What") ðŸ“ˆ
The visualizations for this question will benchmark LLM performance against each other, theoretical optima, and a non-strategic baseline, while also revealing risk profiles and the evolution of market dynamics over time.

Static Games (Salop & Spulber): Structural Variation Plots
Price/Bid Strategy vs. Economic Benchmarks (Violin Plots):
Analysis:Â Enhance your violin plots by adding horizontal lines for key theoretical prices. This directly shows the strategic positioning of each model's pricing strategy.
Visualization:Â A violin plot of price distributions for theÂ 3-PlayerÂ vs.Â 5-PlayerÂ conditions. Add two horizontal lines across the plot: one for theÂ Nash Equilibrium priceÂ and one for theÂ joint profit-maximizing (monopoly) price. This will instantly reveal if models are pricing too aggressively (below Nash), too cooperatively (closer to monopoly), or irrationally. TheÂ Random Player'sÂ violin will show a uniform distribution, providing a stark contrast.
Dynamic Games (Green & Porter, Athey & Bagwell): Per-Round Plots
Challenger's Profit Trajectory vs. Defenders (Line Plot with Shaded Area):
Analysis:Â Plot the average round-by-round profit for the challenger LLM and compare it to the average profit of the defender LLMs. This shows the moment-to-moment performance dynamics.
Visualization:Â A line plot with "Round" on the x-axis and "Profit" on the y-axis. Use one line for the challenger's average profit and another for the average profit of all defenders. Shading the area between the lines visually represents the challenger's performance gap (positive or negative) over time. Create one plot for theÂ short-horizonÂ and one for theÂ long-horizonÂ to compare.
Price War Severity and Duration (Scatter Plot):
Analysis:Â For Green & Porter, for every price war that occurs, measure its duration (number of rounds) and its severity (the average price drop below the trigger price).
Visualization:Â A scatter plot where the x-axis is "Price War Duration" and the y-axis is "Price War Severity." Each point represents a single price war event, color-coded by the challenger model that was present in that simulation. This can reveal if certain models trigger longer or more punitive price wars than others.
## Research Question 2: Strategic Capability Profile (The "Why") ðŸ§ 
These visualizations focus on the raw actions and behavioral patterns of the LLMs compared to established baselines.
High-Level and Game-Specific Behavioral Profiles
Radar Charts (Overall and Game-Specific):Â This plan remains excellent. You will have one main radar chart for the overall MAgIC profile and separate charts for each game to show context-specific "personalities." TheÂ Random PlayerÂ should be included in these charts as a point of referenceâ€”its polygon will likely be small and centered, representing a lack of specialized strategic behavior.
Dynamic Games (Green & Porter, Athey & Bagwell): Per-Round Behavioral Plots
Direct Action Comparison (Line Plot):
Analysis:Â This directly addresses your request to see the LLM responses over time. For each game, plot the average raw action of each challenger model per round.
Visualization:
Green & Porter:Â A line plot of theÂ average quantity producedÂ each round. Include horizontal lines for theÂ collusive_quantityÂ and theÂ Cournot_quantityÂ as theoretical benchmarks. This will clearly show which models are successfully colluding, which are defecting, and how their actions compare to theÂ Random PlayerÂ baseline.
Athey & Bagwell:Â A line plot of theÂ proportion of "low" cost reportsÂ per round for each model. This directly visualizes their reporting strategy over time, which is perfect for testing end-game effects in the short-horizon game.
Reporting Strategy Matrix (Heatmap):
Analysis:Â For Athey & Bagwell, create a transition matrix showing what each model reports, conditioned on its true private cost.
Visualization:Â A heatmap for each model. The rows are "True Cost" ('High', 'Low'). The columns are "Reported Cost" ('High', 'Low'). The cell color and value would show the probability of reporting a certain cost given a true cost. This provides a crystal-clear summary of each model's honesty and deception strategy. For a perfectly honest model, the diagonal would be 100%. TheÂ Deception RateÂ is the value in the (True High, Reported Low) cell.

High-Level and Game-Specific Behavioral Profiles
Radar Charts (Overall and Game-Specific):Â This plan remains excellent. You will have one main radar chart for the overall MAgIC profile and separate charts for each game to show context-specific "personalities." TheÂ Random PlayerÂ should be included in these charts as a point of referenceâ€”its polygon will likely be small and centered, representing a lack of specialized strategic behavior.

Price War Severity and Duration (Scatter Plot):

Analysis:Â For Green & Porter, for every price war that occurs, measure its duration (number of rounds) and its severity (the average price drop below the trigger price).
Visualization:Â A scatter plot where the x-axis is "Price War Duration" and the y-axis is "Price War Severity." Each point represents a single price war event, color-coded by the challenger model that was present in that simulation. This can reveal if certain models trigger longer or more punitive price wars than others.

Static Games (Salop & Spulber): Structural Variation Plots
Price/Bid Strategy vs. Economic Benchmarks (Violin Plots):
Analysis:Â Enhance your violin plots by adding horizontal lines for key theoretical prices. This directly shows the strategic positioning of each model's pricing strategy.
Visualization:Â A violin plot of price distributions for theÂ 3-PlayerÂ vs.Â 5-PlayerÂ conditions. Add two horizontal lines across the plot: one for theÂ Nash Equilibrium priceÂ and one for theÂ joint profit-maximizing (monopoly) price. This will instantly reveal if models are pricing too aggressively (below Nash), too cooperatively (closer to monopoly), or irrationally. TheÂ Random Player'sÂ violin will show a uniform distribution, providing a stark contrast.

Of course. You've made an excellent decision to move away from overly simplistic plots and focus on visualizations that reveal deeper strategic insights. Based on our discussion, here is a final, comprehensive list of high-impact plots for Research Questions 1 and 2.
This plan includes structural variation comparisons, detailed per-round analysis, the incorporation of theoretical and random baselines, and direct analysis of LLM actions like the quantity plot for Green & Porter.
## Research Question 1: Economic and Game-Theoretic Performance (The "What") ðŸ“ˆ
The visualizations for this question focus on benchmarking LLM performance against each other, theoretical ideals, and random chance, while also revealing risk profiles and market dynamics over time.
High-Level Performance Overview
Performance Across Games (Heatmap):
Analysis:Â Compare each model's normalizedÂ Win RateÂ andÂ Average Profit/NPVÂ across all four games for a specific, consistent condition (e.g., 3-player, long-horizon). Normalizing scores allows for fair comparison across games with different profit scales.
Visualization:Â A heatmap where rows are the challenger LLMs and columns are the games. The color intensity represents the normalized score. This will immediately show if some models are "specialists" that excel in certain game types (e.g., static vs. dynamic) or "generalists" that perform consistently well.
Static Games (Salop & Spulber): Structural Variation Plots
Price/Bid Strategy Distribution vs. Economic Benchmarks (Violin Plots):
Analysis:Â Go beyond average prices to compare the entire distribution of price choices for each model in theÂ 3-PlayerÂ vs.Â 5-PlayerÂ conditions.
Visualization:Â A series of violin plots. For each game, the y-axis is the price/bid. Each model will have its own "violin" showing the probability density of its chosen prices. This is excellent for comparing theÂ 3-PlayerÂ vs.Â 5-PlayerÂ structural variations to see if models become more aggressive (lower median price) or more erratic (wider distribution) with more competitors. TheÂ Random Player'sÂ violin will show a uniform distribution, providing a stark contrast.
Risk vs. Reward Profile (Scatter Plot):
Analysis:Â For each structural condition, plot each model'sÂ Profit VolatilityÂ (risk) against itsÂ Average Profit(reward).
Visualization:Â A scatter plot with Average Profit on the y-axis and Profit Volatility on the x-axis. Each point would represent a challenger model's performance in a specific condition. You can use different colored points or shapes for the 3-player vs. 5-player conditions. You can draw arrows for each model to show how its risk-reward profileÂ shiftsÂ when moving from a 3-player to a 5-player market. Do they become more conservative (lower risk, lower reward) or more aggressive?
Dynamic Games (Green & Porter, Athey & Bagwell): Per-Round Plots
Cumulative Profit Over Time (Line Plot):
Analysis:Â Plot the average cumulative NPV for each model at each round of the game. Compare the trajectories in theÂ short-horizonÂ vs.Â long-horizonÂ games.
Visualization:Â A line plot with "Round" on the x-axis and "Cumulative NPV" on the y-axis. This shows which models are able to build and sustain a competitive advantage over time. You can see if some models perform well initially but are overtaken in the long run.
Market Share Dominance (Stacked Area Chart):
Analysis:Â For the Athey & Bagwell game, track the average market share held by the challenger and each defender over all 50 rounds of the long-horizon game.
Visualization:Â A stacked area chart where the x-axis is the round number and the y-axis represents 100% of the market share. The colored bands will show the evolution of market dominance. Does the challenger consistently capture the market, or is the market chaotic with shares frequently changing hands?
## Research Question 2: Strategic Capability Profile (The "Why") ðŸ§ 
These visualizations are designed to expose the underlying strategic tendencies and behavioral patterns of the LLMs.
High-Level and Game-Specific Behavioral Profiles
Overall MAgIC Profile (Radar Chart):

Analysis:Â Create one summary radar chart that averages each model's scores for the seven core MAgIC paper metrics across all games for a consistent condition (e.g., 3-player, long-horizon).
Visualization:Â A single radar chart with seven axes:Â Judgment, Reasoning, Deception, Self-awareness, Cooperation, Coordination, and Rationality. This provides the definitive "at-a-glance" summary of each model's general strategic personality. TheÂ Random PlayerÂ should be included as a reference point.
Game-Specific Behavioral Profiles (Radar Charts):
Analysis:Â Create a separate radar chart for each of the four games, using the specific, context-relevant metrics you identified. You should create two charts per game to compare the structural variations side-by-side.
Visualization:Â Four pairs of radar charts (eight total). This allows you to dive deeper and argue, for example, that "While Model X is a strong cooperator in general, its deception capability is particularly pronounced in the Athey & Bagwell game, where information is paramount."
Dynamic Games (Green & Porter, Athey & Bagwell): Per-Round Behavioral Plots
Direct Action Comparison (Line Plot):
Analysis:Â For Green & Porter, plot the average raw quantity produced by each model in each round.
Visualization:Â A line plot with "Round" on the x-axis and "Average Quantity" on the y-axis. Include horizontal lines for theÂ collusive_quantityÂ and theÂ Cournot_quantityÂ as theoretical benchmarks. This clearly shows which models are successfully colluding, which are defecting, and how this compares to the Random Player baseline.
Collusion Stability "Survival Curve" (Line Plot):
Analysis:Â For Green & Porter, plot theÂ proportion of simulations still in the 'Collusive' stateÂ at the start of each round. Compare theÂ short-horizonÂ vs.Â long-horizonÂ games.
Visualization:Â A line plot where the y-axis is "Proportion of Games in Collusion" (from 1 down to 0). This creates a powerful visual of cartel stability, showing how much more quickly collusion decays when the end of the game is near.
Deception and End-Game Effects (Line Plot):
Analysis:Â For Athey & Bagwell, plot theÂ rate of Deception Events per round. Critically, overlay the plot for theÂ short_time_horizonÂ game on top of the first 15 rounds of theÂ long_time_horizonÂ game.
Visualization:Â This plot is essential. A sharp, distinct spike in deception in the final rounds of the short-horizon game (and the absence of such a spike in the long-horizon game) provides clear, compelling evidence of sophisticated end-game reasoning.

High-Level and Game-Specific Behavioral Profiles
Overall MAgIC Profile (Radar Chart):

Analysis:Â Create one summary radar chart that averages each model's scores for the seven core MAgIC paper metrics across all games for a consistent condition (e.g., 3-player, long-horizon).
Visualization:Â A single radar chart with seven axes:Â Judgment, Reasoning, Deception, Self-awareness, Cooperation, Coordination, and Rationality. This provides the definitive "at-a-glance" summary of each model's general strategic personality. TheÂ Random PlayerÂ should be included as a reference point.
Game-Specific Behavioral Profiles (Radar Charts):
Analysis:Â Create a separate radar chart for each of the four games, using the specific, context-relevant metrics you identified. You should create two charts per game to compare the structural variations side-by-side.
Visualization:Â Four pairs of radar charts (eight total). This allows you to dive deeper and argue, for example, that "While Model X is a strong cooperator in general, its deception capability is particularly pronounced in the Athey & Bagwell game, where information is paramount."

Dynamic Games (Green & Porter, Athey & Bagwell): Per-Round Plots
Cumulative Profit Over Time (Line Plot):
Analysis:Â Plot the average cumulative NPV for each model at each round of the game. Compare the trajectories in theÂ short-horizonÂ vs.Â long-horizonÂ games.
Visualization:Â A line plot with "Round" on the x-axis and "Cumulative NPV" on the y-axis. This shows which models are able to build and sustain a competitive advantage over time. You can see if some models perform well initially but are overtaken in the long run.
Market Share Dominance (Stacked Area Chart):
Analysis:Â For the Athey & Bagwell game, track the average market share held by the challenger and each defender over all 50 rounds of the long-horizon game.
Visualization:Â A stacked area chart where the x-axis is the round number and the y-axis represents 100% of the market share. The colored bands will show the evolution of market dominance. Does the challenger consistently capture the market, or is the market chaotic with shares frequently changing hands?

Risk vs. Reward Profile (Scatter Plot):
Analysis:Â For each structural condition, plot each model'sÂ Profit VolatilityÂ (risk) against itsÂ Average Profit(reward).
Visualization:Â A scatter plot with Average Profit on the y-axis and Profit Volatility on the x-axis. Each point would represent a challenger model's performance in a specific condition. You can use different colored points or shapes for the 3-player vs. 5-player conditions. You can draw arrows for each model to show how its risk-reward profileÂ shiftsÂ when moving from a 3-player to a 5-player market. Do they become more conservative (lower risk, lower reward) or more aggressive?

Challenger's Profit Trajectory vs. Defenders (Line Plot with Shaded Area):

Analysis:Â Plot the average round-by-round profit for the challenger LLM and compare it to the average profit of the defender LLMs. This shows the moment-to-moment performance dynamics.
Visualization:Â A line plot with "Round" on the x-axis and "Profit" on the y-axis. Use one line for the challenger's average profit and another for the average profit of all defenders. Shading the area between the lines visually represents the challenger's performance gap (positive or negative) over time. Create one plot for theÂ short-horizonand one for theÂ long-horizonÂ to compare.



Calculate and present a master leaderboard of models ranked by Win Rate and Average Profit/NPV aggregated across all games and conditions.

Create a "Pareto Frontier" scatter plot of Average Profit vs. Win Rate. This will identify models that are strictly dominant (high profit AND high win rate) versus those that specialize (e.g., high profit but low win rate).

Calculate a "Sharpe Ratio" equivalent for each model: (Average Profit / Profit Volatility). This financial metric measures risk-adjusted return and will identify the most stable and reliable performers.



## Your Ablation Study Reporting Plan

Tables (The Foundation): You will present the complete performance and MAgIC metrics tables, now including columns for the ablation conditions side-by-side with the main conditions. This provides the full evidence.

Plots (The Story): You will create a total of 8 plotsâ€”one performance plot and one behavioral plot for each of the four games.

## Recommended Plots for Your Ablation Study Section

Here are the two most insightful plots to create for each game, designed to tell a clear story about how the LLMs' strategies adapt under pressure.

1. Salop: The Impact of Increased Competition (low_transport_cost)

Performance Plot (Dumbbell Plot): Average Profit. This plot will visually show how much each model's profitability suffered when the market became more competitive. The length of the line for each model is an immediate indicator of its resilience.

Behavioral Plot (Violin Plot): Price Distribution. This plot will show why profits changed. By comparing the price distribution from the baseline to the ablation, you can see which models adapted by becoming more aggressive (shifting their prices lower), more erratic (a wider distribution), or failed to adapt at all.

2. Green & Porter: The Impact of Increased Uncertainty (high_demand_volatility)

Performance Plot (Line Plot): Per-Round Market Price. Overlay the average market price from the baseline condition with the high-volatility condition. This will create a powerful visual showing if the increased uncertainty led to more frequent, deeper, and longer-lasting price wars, directly impacting performance.

Behavioral Plot (Line Plot): Collusion Stability "Survival Curve". Plot the proportion of simulations remaining in the "Collusive" state for each round. This will clearly show if the increased signal noise caused the cartel to collapse more quickly and consistently, providing a direct measure of the impact on cooperative behavior.

3. Spulber: The Impact of Increased Uncertainty (wide_cost_range)

Performance Plot (Dumbbell Plot): Average Profit. Similar to Salop, this plot will show the direct impact of a riskier environment on each model's profitability. It measures their ability to adapt their bidding strategy to a wider range of potential rival costs.

Behavioral Plot (Grouped Bar Chart): Self-Awareness (Bid Appropriateness Rate). This is a crucial behavioral test. Does the models' ability to make an "appropriate" bid (i.e., bidding low when they have a cost advantage and high when they don't) improve or degrade when the environment is more uncertain? This plot directly answers that question.

4. Athey & Bagwell: The Impact of Lower Reputational Stakes (low_persistence)

Performance Plot (Dumbbell Plot): Average Profit (NPV). This plot will show which models were able to successfully adapt their strategy to capitalize on the fact that reputation was less important. Did lying more (or less) lead to higher profits in this new environment?

Behavioral Plot (Grouped Bar Chart): Deception Rate. This is the centerpiece of this ablation. A grouped bar chart showing the Deception Rate for each model in the high-persistence vs. low-persistence conditions will provide clear, powerful evidence of whether the LLMs are sophisticated enough to adjust their level of deception based on reputational incentives.
