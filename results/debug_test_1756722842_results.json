            "reasoning": "Given the two-firm structure in this Salop circular market, competition is relatively limited, but still present. My marginal cost is $8.00, and my fixed cost is $100.00. I need to price above my marginal cost to cover my fixed costs and generate a profit. The theoretical equilibrium price according to the spatial equilibrium theory is $8.25 which would not cover my fixed costs. \n\nConsidering my neighbors' prices and spatial position, a conservative strategy of $12.00 might seem reasonable, but I think I can capture a bit more market share while still maintaining healthy margins. An aggressive strategy of $10.00 would put pressure on my neighbors, but I am aiming to maintain a more stable equilibrium for the round.\n\nTherefore, I choose a price of $11.50. This price allows me to capture a slightly larger market share than a $12.00 price, while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin above my $8.00 marginal cost. By capturing a larger market share, I can cover my $100.00 fixed cost and hopefully generate a profit.\n\nI think my neighbors will also aim for a price in the region of $11 to $12.50, in which case I think $11.50 represents a good trade-off between market share, profit margin, and stability.",
